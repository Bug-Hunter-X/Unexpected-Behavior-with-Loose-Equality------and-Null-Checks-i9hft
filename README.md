# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`) and null checks.  Loose equality can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types, especially when dealing with `null`.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to handle `null` values. However, due to the use of loose equality, it may still produce unexpected outcomes. 

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function.  It uses strict equality (`===`) to correctly handle null values and improve type checking for other variables.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and examine the code.
3. Run the test cases to observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code and test the improved results.

## Additional Notes
Using strict equality (`===`) is generally recommended in JavaScript to avoid unexpected type coercion.
